## Bulwark - ERLC Handbook

Before we start, I strived to make as many features work for Solara/Celery. Though, features like No Recoil, Inf Ammo, No Drown etc., are simply not possible. Use Wave for the best experience.

游릭 - Means solara supports this.

**Player Tab:**

* **WARNING:**  I highly suggest you do not use the features in this tab. They are insanely blatant and will most likely get you banned.

* **WalkSpeed:** This feature allows you to increase your walking speed using additive velocity.  Be cautious as using high values is very obvious. 游릭

* **FOV:**  Changes your field of view (how much you can see). A higher FOV can make it easier to see around you, but it can also be disorienting.  游릭

* **Infinite Jump:** Allows you to jump infinitely without touching the ground. Extremely blatant. 游릭

* **Fly:** Enables flying. You can control your movement with WASD keys and adjust the speed with the slider.  **Use with extreme caution!** 游릭

* **No-Clip:** Allows you to walk through walls and objects. 游릭

* **No-Drown:** Allows you to go underwater and not die.
* **No-Ragdoll:** Doesn't allow you to ragdoll. 游릭
* **Inf Stamina:** Gives you inf stamina.

**Vehicle Tab:**

* **(LEGACY) Max Speed:**  Increases the maximum speed of your vehicle. May be unstable. This does not actually increase the max speed of the car. This is a solara function, and we only apply velocity to the car directly. 游릭

* **(LEGACY) Acceleration:** Increases the acceleration of your vehicle. May be unstable. Used with Max Speed enabled. 游릭

* **Wheel Height:** Modifies the height of your vehicle's wheels. 游릭

* **Suspension:** Adjusts the stiffness of your vehicle's suspension. 游릭

* **Horsepower:** Changes the horsepower of your vehicle, affecting its acceleration and power.

* **Anti-Collision:** Disables collision for your vehicle, allowing you to drive through other vehicles and objects. 游릭

* **Infinite Fuel:** Gives your vehicle unlimited fuel. 游릭


**Weapons Tab:**

* **Aimbot Section:**

    * **Aimbot Enabled:** Activates the aimbot, automatically aiming at the closest enemy within your FOV. 游릭

    * **Target Body Part:** Selects which body part the aimbot will target (Head or HumanoidRootPart). (Useless, you always want head) 游릭

    * **Wall Check:**  If enabled, the aimbot will only target enemies that are not behind walls. 游릭

    * **Team Check:** If enabled, the aimbot will not target players on your team. 游릭

    * **Only Hostiles:** If enabled, the aimbot will only target players on enemy teams (Criminals, DOT, Fire). 游릭

    * **FOV Circle:**  Adjusts the size of the aimbot's field of view. A larger FOV means the aimbot will target enemies further away. 游릭

* **Weapon Modifications Section:**

    * **Rapid Fire:**  Significantly increases the fire rate of your weapons.

    * **Instant Reload:** Makes your weapons reload almost instantly.

    * **Inf Ammo:** Gives you unlimited ammunition.

    * **No Recoil:** Removes the recoil from your weapons, making them more accurate.


**Teleports Tab:**

* **Teleport Place:**  Select a location from the dropdown list to teleport to. 游릭

* **Teleport With Vehicle:**  If enabled, your vehicle will teleport with you. 游릭

* **Teleport:**  Initiates the teleport to the selected location. 游릭

** Auto Tab **

* **Auto-Arrest:** Automatically arrests the closest civilian with the highest wanted level. Due to how streaming enabled works, you might want to get inside your car and drive around the map because not all players are loaded. 游릭
 
* **Arrest Aura:** Automatically arrests all civilians near you. You have to be close, due to how the game works. Also, dont forget to equip your handcuffs. 游릭

**Misc Tab:**

* **Time Of Day:**  Changes the in-game time of day. 游릭

* **ESP:**  Highlights players within a certain range, making them easier to see.  The closer a player is, the brighter the highlight. 游릭

* **Invisible:** Makes you invisible. Press X to toggle invisibility on and off.  **WARNING: May be buggy and unreliable!** 游릭

* **Respawn:** Kills your character and respawns you. 游릭

* **Remove Street Lamps:** Removes all street lamps from the game. (So you can't crash) 游릭

* **Remove Trees:** Removes all trees from the game. (Less lag + no crash) 游릭

* **Remove Deployables:** Removes all deployable objects (like spike strips) from the game. 游릭

* **Remove Traffic Detection:**  Removes traffic detection (speed) systems from the game. 游릭


**GUI Tab:**

* **Accent:** Changes the accent color of the GUI. 游릭

* **Keybind For UI:**  Allows you to change the keybind used to open and close the GUI. 游릭
